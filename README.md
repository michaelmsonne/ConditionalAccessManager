## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Microsoft.Graph PowerShell module
- Appropriate permissions in Microsoft Entra ID:
  - `Policy.Read.All` (to read policies)

2. Import the module:

```powershell
Import-Module .\ConditionalAccessManager
```

3. Connect to Microsoft Graph:

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.Read.All", "Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess"
```

## Usage

### Interactive Console

Start the interactive menu-driven console:

```powershell
Start-ConditionalAccessManagerConsole
```

### Individual Commands

```powershell
# List deleted policies
Get-DeletedConditionalAccessPolicies

# List with full details
Get-DeletedConditionalAccessPolicies -IncludeDetails

# Restore a specific policy
Restore-ConditionalAccessPolicy -PolicyId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"

# Permanently remove a deleted policy
Remove-DeletedConditionalAccessPolicy -PolicyId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" -Force

# Export policies to JSON
Export-ConditionalAccessPolicies -OutputPath "C:\backup\ca-policies.json" -IncludeActive -IncludeDeleted
```

## Examples

### Basic Policy Recovery

```powershell
# Connect to Graph
Connect-MgGraph

# List deleted policies
$deletedPolicies = Get-DeletedConditionalAccessPolicies
$deletedPolicies | Format-Table

# Restore the first policy
if ($deletedPolicies.Count -gt 0) {
    Restore-ConditionalAccessPolicy -PolicyId $deletedPolicies[0].id
}
```

### Bulk Operations

```powershell
# Get all deleted policies and restore them
Get-DeletedConditionalAccessPolicies | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Restoring: $($_.displayName)"
    Restore-ConditionalAccessPolicy -PolicyId $_.id
}
```

### Export and Backup

# Create comprehensive backup
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss"
Export-ConditionalAccessPolicies -OutputPath ".\CA-Backup-$timestamp.json" -IncludeActive -IncludeDeleted
```

## Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Authentication errors** - Clear messages when not connected to Graph
- **Permission errors** - Specific guidance on required scopes
- **API errors** - Detailed error messages from Graph API
- **Validation** - Input validation for policy IDs and file paths

## Security Considerations

- Always use least-privilege permissions
- Regularly audit restored policies
- Keep backups of policy configurations
- Test in non-production environments first
